# gSNE
gSNE is an extended version of the tSNE algorithm, offering enhanced capabilities for dimensionality reduction. It can effectively reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving its essential features.

It was my course project in the Master's program at Novosibirsk State University in 2022. The project required the study of data visualization methods and the exploration of a new approach related to the generalization of the tSNE method. This problem is relevant because the task of visualizing high-dimensional data is a crucial step in the preliminary analysis of almost any machine learning task.

The obtained results were presented at 60th International Student Scientific Conference ISSC and were awarded a first-degree diploma.
